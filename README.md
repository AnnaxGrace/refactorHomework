# refactorHomework


The page originally had everything before <body> on the same line, so I added tabs to clean it up.
    So I indented meta, title, script, and link

The first div was directly below body so I idented it over and updated all of the rest of the indents

I lined up the <p> beginnings and ends so it was clear when they... began and ended

I put a </b> on its own line for clarity

I lined up the two <h2> elements

I added comments to different classes to explain them further

I added alts to all the images in <div id="homephoto">

In <div id="socialnetworking"> I updated the classes to say "sociallogo" (for instance "facebooklogo") so that the title and the class were not redundant

I added a footer tag to the copyright
